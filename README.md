# Hypercore Protocol Docs
The Hypercore Protocol is a set of data structures and networking tools you can use to build fast and safe P2P systems. In this repo you'll find links to resources that will help get you up and running with Hypercore.

We'll be continually adding new introductory docs to this repo, so check back soon!

## Getting Started
If you're new to the Hypercore Protocol, we recommend you install [Hyperspace](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperspace), which is a server that handles a bunch of the nitty-gritty of P2P networking for you.

## Workshops

### [Intro to P2P Indexing and Search]()
Our workshop for [NodeConf Remote 2020](https://www.nodeconfremote.com/) has a bunch of exercises, starting at square one, that guide you through setting up Hyperspace, designing data structures on Hypercore, and eventually building and querying a large P2P database of IMDB data (metadata about movies and TV shows). 

## FAQs
